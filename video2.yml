      The new version of Living Doc allows you to define a default language for your builds.
      Previously,  English was the default language used to parse feature files.
  - narration: Select your  project language in the build step from the drop-down list

      Furthermore, the list of builds has been improved. 
      The list now only includes those builds that include the SpecFlow+ build step, 
      and the entries are now sorted alphabetically. 
      
      This is a real time-saver in cases where you have a lot of builds.
